# Rust Actix test
Dummy repo that creates a simple game to explore how the [Actix](https://actix.rs/docs/actix) framework can be used to handle concurrency and asynchronous messaging in rust. The game generates several random number generators. A game board implementing the Actor trait is then instantiated and its address is passed to the random generators. Whenever a generator generates a number, a Message is sent to the scoreboard which updates the standings. A similar game but build using the `Arc<Mutex<T>>` pattern is also implemented [here](https://github.com/Jibbril/rust-observer-async-test) for comparison.
